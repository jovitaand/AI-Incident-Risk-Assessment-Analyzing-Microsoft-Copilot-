# AI Incident Risk Assessment: Analyzing Microsoft AI Ethics and Stakeholder Impact

## Project Overview

This project analyzes incidents related to Microsoft’s AI systems documented in the **AIAAIC (AI, Algorithmic, and Automation Incidents and Controversies) Repository**. The project aims to assess the risks, ethical concerns, and stakeholder impacts associated with deploying Microsoft AI tools, using a data-driven approach. By leveraging insights from the AIAAIC database, we identify patterns in common themes such as privacy violations, misinformation, and bias, and provide recommendations for responsible AI adoption.

## Objectives

1. **Risk Assessment**: Predict potential harms and assess risk levels associated with AI incidents.
2. **Thematic Analysis**: Identify common themes (privacy, bias, misinformation) across Microsoft-related incidents.
3. **Stakeholder Analysis**: Understand the impact on individuals, communities, businesses, and environmental factors.
4. **Ethical Analysis**: Apply ethical frameworks to guide decision-making in responsible AI deployment.
5. **Recommendations**: Provide actionable recommendations for organizations considering Microsoft AI tools.

## Dataset Overview

- **Source**: [AIAAIC Repository](https://www.aiaaic.org/aiaaic-repository) - A publicly available database documenting incidents and controversies related to AI, algorithms, and automation.
- **Structure**: The dataset includes incident details such as `Incident ID`, `Headline`, `Type`, `Country`, `Sector`, `Issues`, `External Harms`, `Internal Harms`, and descriptions.
- **Key Fields**:
  - **Incident ID**: Unique identifier for each incident
  - **Type**: Categorizes the incident (e.g., "Issue" or "Incident")
  - **Country**: Geographic area affected
  - **Issues**: Ethical or operational issues associated with the incident (e.g., privacy, security)
  - **External Harms**: Types of harm to external stakeholders, such as privacy loss or defamation

```

### Analysis and Insights:

View analysis notebooks in notebooks/ for detailed insights on themes, stakeholders, and ethical considerations.

### Results and Insights

* Key Themes: Privacy, misinformation, and bias are the most frequent themes associated with Microsoft AI incidents.
* Stakeholder Impact: Individuals are most affected by privacy violations, while communities face discrimination and environmental concerns.
* Ethical Implications: Applying ethical frameworks highlights the importance of transparency, privacy protection, and accountability in Microsoft AI deployments.
